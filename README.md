# servantRestfulAPI
THis is an example of a RestfulAPI made with Servant Haskell and which integrates things like Persistent MySQL, ElasticSearch, 
JWT for token based authentication, etc... 

This RestfulAPI was made according to the principles of Functional Domain Modeling in which APIs are defined as abstract algebras
with abstract data types. Also, actual code is implemented in the form of interpreters (for algebras) and repositories 
(code which handles DB actions).
